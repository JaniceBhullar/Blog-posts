// memory leak: The browser keeps objects in heap memory while they can be reached from the root 
// through the reference chain. Garbage Collector is a background process in the JavaScript engine 
// that identifies unreachable objects, removes them, and reclaims the underlying memory.
// A memory leak occurs when an object in memory that is supposed to be cleaned in a garbage 
// collection cycle stays reachable from the root through an unintentional reference by another 
// object. Keeping redundant objects in memory results in excessive memory use inside the app and 
// can lead to degraded and poor performance.

// When you use the useEffect hook, you have the option to return a cleanup function. 
// This cleanup function is used to clean up any resources or effects that were created in the hook.  
// You can clean side effects like fetching data from an API, setting up event listeners, 
// or creating intervals or timeouts. Letâ€™s cover these side effects one by one.

// useEffect cleanup function can takes place in two incidents:

// When a component using the useEffect hook unmounts.
// When the dependency array in the useEffect hook changes as it triggers a re-render of the component.
// It is used to tidy up any unwanted effects that were created during the component's lifespan, 
// and we can also use it to perform additional cleanup tasks.
